# XmlTest
A simple example of using the cpxml classes that come with Clarion

This sample program shows two things at the moment:

1. Load an XML document and view it in the ViewXml procedure found in cpxml.clw
2. Take that same document and traverse the nodes within, writing the node name and value to the console.

It is not much but hopefully gives a quick insight into using the classes and maybe the project could serve as a handy way to get started!

Oh, see here for how to fix a memory leak in the cpxml.clw! http://clarionhub.com/t/memory-leak-in-cpxml-clw/346
